**Dataset**

We collected a recycling waste dataset which contains 1872 images with dimensions of 384x512. The dataset may be accessed at the link below:

[Xueying Li Waste dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OcsQeY-yLjZrfX_6UDBKhmlnFg1JSQA_?usp=share_link/)


In addition to the above dataset, we also used a public dataset which may be downloaded from the authors' GitHub page at the link below
